# Datastructures
Some important datastructures implemented in C++ . This is mainly for people trying to understand basic datastructres and give them skeleton code to work with. Objective is to not have makefiles and build system complexity so we can focus more on the datastructures. Checkout this repository and do "g++ main.cpp" to build the files.
